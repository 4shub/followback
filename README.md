# FollowGroup
Followgroup is a tool used to follow a group of twitter users that are in an array.


### Usage
You need Node and NPM to run this program and a valid twitter key to use this program

Download it, navigate to the root of these files in cmd/terminal and type "node app.js" 

To view the application go to localhost:3030 in your browser.


#### Change the groups of users.
To change the group of twitter users to follow, replace the names in the array (found in Data.js) with the users you want others to follow.

### Developing
Probably won't develop any further than I already did on this project. Feel free to make it more streamlined.
