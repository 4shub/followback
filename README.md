Followback
==========
A NodeJs Application to follow back a list of users.

Setup
==========
Go to terminal/cmd and navigate to the root, type Node App.js to start the program.


Changing the list
==========
The list is an array located in the data.js folder. I don't plan to addding anything more to the project.
